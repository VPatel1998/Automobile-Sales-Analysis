# Automobile Sales Analysis Using Data Visualization

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project involves **creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium** to analyze historical automobile sales data during recession periods. The goal is to provide insights into how economic downturns impacted automotive sales patterns for XYZAutomotives.

## 📅 Recession Periods Analyzed
- 1980  
- 1981 to 1982  
- 1991  
- 2000 to 2001  
- 2007 to mid-2009  
- 2020 (Feb to April, Covid-19 Impact)

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed historical data on automobile sales and several economic and market variables, both in recession and non-recession periods:
- **Date**: Date of observation  
- **Recession**: Binary flag (1=recession, 0=normal)  
- **Automobile_Sales**: Number of vehicles sold  
- **GDP**: Per capita GDP (USD)  
- **Unemployment_Rate**: Monthly unemployment rate  
- **Consumer_Confidence**: Synthetic consumer confidence index  
- **Seasonality_Weight**: Weight representing seasonal effects on sales  
- **Price**: Average vehicle price  
- **Advertising_Expenditure**: Company advertising expenses  
- **Vehicle_Type**: Categories including Supermini, Small Family Car, Medium Family Car, Executive Car, Sports  
- **Competition**: Market competition measure (competitors/market share)  
- **Month**: Extracted month from Date  
- **Year**: Extracted year from Date

## 📊 Key Analytical Focus
- Understand sales fluctuations during recessions vs. normal periods  
- Compare sales trends by vehicle type and economic factors  
- Explore seasonality and advertising impacts on sales  
- Correlate prices and unemployment with sales trends  

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboards with Plotly & Dash
- Developed dynamic dashboards with **drop-down menus** and **callbacks**  
- Allows directors to explore specific years, vehicle types, and reports interactively  
- Provides real-time visual insights into recession impacts and yearly sales trends

## 💡 Outcome
This project equips XYZAutomotives’ decision-makers with data-driven insights to strategically navigate and plan during economic recessions using comprehensive visual and interactive tools.
